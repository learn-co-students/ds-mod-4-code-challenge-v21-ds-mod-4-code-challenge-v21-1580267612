<h1 style="text-align:center">Module 6 Assessment</h1>

Welcome to your Mod 6 Assessment. You will be tested for your understanding of concepts and ability to programmatically solve problems that have been covered in class and in the curriculum. Topics in this assessment include graph theory, natural language processing, and neural networks. 

The goal here is to demonstrate your knowledge. Showing that you know things about certain concepts is more important than getting the best model.

Use any libraries you want to solve the problems in the assessment. 

You will have up to 90 minutes to complete this assessment. 

The sections of the assessment are:

* Natural Language Processing
* Network Analysis
* Perceptrons and Multi-Layer Perceptrons
* Regularization and Optimization of Neural Networks

## Natural Language Processing

In this exercise we will attempt to classify text messages as "SPAM" or "HAM" using TF-IDF Vectorization. Once we successfully classify our texts we will examine our results to see which words are most important to each class of text messages. 

Complete the functions below and answer the question(s) at the end.

### TF-IDF


```python
#separate features and labels 
X = df_messages['v2']
y = df_messages['target']

```


```python
# __SOLUTION__ 
#separate features and labels 
X = df_messages['v2']
y = df_messages['target']

```


```python
#generate a list of stopwords 
stopwords_list = stopwords.words('english') + list(string.punctuation)

```


```python
# __SOLUTION__ 
#generate a list of stopwords 
stopwords_list = stopwords.words('english') + list(string.punctuation)

```

<b>1) Let's create a function that takes in our various texts along with their respective labels and uses TF-IDF to vectorize the texts.  Recall that TF-IDF helps us "vectorize" text (turn text into numbers) so we can do "math" with it.  It is used to reflect how relevant a term is in a given document in a numerical way. </b>


```python
#generate tf-idf vectorization (use sklearn's TfidfVectorizer) for our data
def tfidf(X, y,  stopwords_list): 
    '''

You can see both classifiers do a pretty good job classifying texts as either "SPAM" or "HAM". Let's figure out which words are the most important to each class of texts! Recall that Inverse Document Frequency can help us determine which words are most important in an entire corpus or group of documents. 

<b>3) Create a function that calculates the IDF of each word in our collection of texts.</b>


```python
def get_idf(class_, df, stopwords_list):
    '''
    Get ten words with lowest IDF values representing 10 most important
    words for a defined class (spam or ham)
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    class_ : str object
        string defining class 'spam' or 'ham'
    df : pandas DataFrame object
        data frame containing texts and labels
    stopwords_list: list object
        List containing words and punctuation to remove. 
    --------
    important_10 : pandas dataframe object
        Dataframe containing 10 words and respective IDF values
        representing the 10 most important words found in the texts
        associated with the defined class
    '''
    #generate series containing all texts associated with the defined class
    docs = 'code here'
    
    #initialize dictionary to count document frequency 
    # (number of documents that contain a certain word)
    class_dict = {}
    
    #loop over each text and split each text into a list of its unique words 
    for doc in docs:
        words = set(doc.split())
        
        #loop over each word and if it is not in the stopwords_list add the word 
        #to class_dict with a value of 1. if it is already in the dictionary
        #increment it by 1
        
    #take our dictionary and calculate the 
    #IDF (number of docs / number of docs containing each word) 
    #for each word and return the 10 words with the lowest IDF 
    pass

### Explain
<b> 4) Imagine that the word "school" has the highest TF-IDF value in the second document of our test data. What does that tell us about the word school? </b>


```python
# Your answer here
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__
# Answer: The word, school is very unique. It is not found frequently across 
# many documents but its present in the second document meaning it has significant importance to this document.
```

## Network Analysis

For these next questions, you'll be using a graph dataset of facebook users and networkx. In the next cell, we're going to read in the dataset.


```python
import networkx as nx
G = nx.read_edgelist('./data/0.edges')
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__ 
import networkx as nx
G = nx.read_edgelist('./data/0.edges')
```

###### 1) Create a function `find_centrality` that returns a dictionary with the user with the highest betweenness centrality and the user with the highest degree centrality. It should return a dictionary that looks like:


{'bc' : |user|, 'dc' : |user|}


```python
def find_centrality(graph):
    """
    Calculates the most central nodes on a graph
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    graph: networkx Graph object
        Graph object to be analyzed
    Returns
    --------
    centrality_dict : dict
        A dictionary with the highest ranked user based off degree centrality and betweenness centrality 
    """
    pass
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__ 
def find_centrality(graph):
    bc = nx.algorithms.centrality.betweenness_centrality(graph)
    max_bc = max(bc.items(), key = lambda kv : kv[1] )
    print('betweenness centrality: ',max_bc)
    dc = nx.algorithms.centrality.degree_centrality(graph)
    max_dc = max(dc.items(), key= lambda kv : kv[1])
    print('degree centrality: ', max_dc)
    centrality_dict = {'bc':max_bc[0],'dc':max_dc[0]}
    return centrality_dict
```

#### 2) How does each of these people wield influence on the network? Imagine a message had to get to people from different communities. Who would be the best user to deliver the message to ensure that people from opposite communities receive the message?


```python
# __SOLUTION__ 
find_centrality(G)
```

    betweenness centrality:  ('277', 0.2658578437822957)
    degree centrality:  ('56', 0.23192771084337352)





    {'bc': '277', 'dc': '56'}



// answer here //


```python
# Your answer here
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__
# The user with the highest degree centrality has the most overall connections.
# The user with the highest betweenness centrality has the most connections go through them. 
# The user with the highest betweenness centrality (277) would be the best person to
# ensure that people from disparate communities receive the message.
```

#### 3) A marketing group is looking to target different communities with advertisements based off of their assumed mutual interests. 

#### Use the `k_cliques_communities` method to calculate the number of cliques formed with k users in a function `find_k_communities`. Calculate how many communities there are if the minimum size of a clique is 5.



```python
def find_k_communities(graph,k):
    """
    Parameters
    ----------
    graph: networkx Graph object
        
    k : int
        k-number of connections required for a clique
    
    Returns
    -------
    num_communities: int
        The number of communities present in the graph
    """
    pass
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__ 
def find_k_communities(graph, k):
    return len(list(nx.algorithms.community.kclique.k_clique_communities(graph, k)))
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__ 
find_k_communities(G, 5)
```

# and then transformation via an activation function e.g. the sigmoid function.
```

##### 3) Describe the process of forward propagation in neural networks


```python
# Your answer here
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__
# Outputs of each perceptron are propagated to each node of the next layer and scaled by weights specific to each of these connections.
```

##### 4) How does what happens in forward-propagation change what happens in back-propagation? Be as specific as possible.


```python
# Your answer here
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__
# Each time the neural network propagates forward for a given batch, there are residuals due to inaccuracy. 
# To update the weights and biases in the network, the derivatives of each term are calculated using 
# these residuals and then simultaneously updated using the process of gradient descent.
```

##### 5) Imagine you are trying classifying audio files into five different classes of sounds. What should your activation function be in the output layer and why? 


```python
# Your answer here
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__
# This is a multi-label problem. There should be one output for each label. 
# If a specific output node is over a certain threshold, then that node's label is assigned to that observation.
# The activation function should be a soft max activation.
```

## Regularization and Optimization of Neural Networks

Now you're going to train full neural networks on a _small_ set of data. It is a binary classification problem in which you need to identify whether or not a dot will belong to the teal or orange class.


```python
np.random.seed(0)
# generate 2d classification dataset
X, y = make_circles(n_samples=450, noise=0.12)
df = pd.DataFrame(dict(x=X[:,0], y=X[:,1], label=y))
colors = {0:'teal', 1:'orange'}
fig, ax = pyplot.subplots()
grouped = df.groupby('label')
for key, group in grouped:
    if key != 2:
        group.plot(ax=ax, kind='scatter', x='x', y='y', label=key, color=colors[key])
pyplot.show()
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__ 
np.random.seed(0)
# generate 2d classification dataset
X, y = make_circles(n_samples=450, noise=0.12)
df = pd.DataFrame(dict(x=X[:,0], y=X[:,1], label=y))
colors = {0:'teal', 1:'orange'}
fig, ax = pyplot.subplots()
grouped = df.groupby('label')
for key, group in grouped:
    if key != 2:
        group.plot(ax=ax, kind='scatter', x='x', y='y', label=key, color=colors[key])
pyplot.show()
```

##### 1) Modify the code below to use L2 regularization


The model appears to be overfitting. To deal with this overfitting, modify the code below to include L2 regularization in the model. 


```python
np.random.seed(0)

#Instantiate Classifier
classifier2 = Sequential()

#Hidden Layer
classifier2.add(Dense(
    32, 
    activation='relu', 
    input_dim=2,
    kernel_initializer='random_normal'

))

predicted_vals_train = classifier2.predict_classes(X_train)
#show accuracy score
print(accuracy_score(y_train,predicted_vals_train))

# TEST

predicted_vals_test = classifier2.predict_classes(X_test)
#show accuracy score
print(accuracy_score(y_test,predicted_vals_test))

```

Did the regularization you performed prevent overfitting?


```python
# Your answer here
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__
# Yes, it did prevent overfitting, we know this because the testing accuracy has improved, even though the training accuracy decreased.
```

##### 2) Explain how regularization is related to the bias/variance tradeoff within Neural Networks and how it's related to the results you just achieved in the training and test accuracies of the previous models. What does regularization change in the training process (be specific to what is being regularized and how it is regularizing)?



```python
# Your answer here
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__
# Regularization helps prevent over fitting by adding penalty terms to the cost function. 
# This prevents any one feature to having too much importance in a model.
```

##### 3) How might L1  and dropout regularization change a neural network's architecture?


```python
# Your answer here
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__
# L1 and dropout regularization may eliminate connections between nodes entirely.
```
